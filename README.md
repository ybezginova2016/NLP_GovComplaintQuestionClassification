## üìù **NLP State Gov Complaint / Question Classification Project**

### **Project Objective**
The objective of this project is to train a machine learning model that classifies user messages into one of two categories: complaint or question. This project is part of the media analytics development group in Moscow.

### **Project Description**
This project involves developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to automatically categorize user messages directed at state and municipal authorities, which are posted on social media, as either complaints or questions. The goal is to improve the efficiency of processing these messages by correctly classifying them.

### **Data**
The data used for this project consists of user messages, including both complaints and questions, addressed to state and municipal authorities. The data can be accessed through the following links:
- **Complaints Data:** [Here](https://github.com/ybezginova2016/NLP_GovComplaintQuestionClassification/blob/main/questions_test.csv)
- **Questions Data:** [Here](https://github.com/ybezginova2016/NLP_GovComplaintQuestionClassification/blob/main/questions_test.csv)

### **Project Methodology**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Perform initial data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the data for model training.
2. **Model Training:** Train classification models using the prepared data.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of different models using quality metrics and select the best model.
4. **Conclusions:** Draw conclusions based on the model's performance and provide recommendations for further improvements.

### **Code**
The complete code for the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, can be found in the Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/ybezginova2016/NLP_GovComplaintQuestionClassification/blob/main/main.ipynb).
